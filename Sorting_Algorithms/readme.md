# Sorting Algorithms

> In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order.

## _Bubble Sort_

Sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top. 
It is an algorithm that compares the adjacent elements and swaps their positions if they are not in the intended order.
Best to use when you know your data is mostly sorted already.


Time Complexity: O(n^2) || Space Complexity: O(1)

## _Selection Sort_

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly **"selecting"** the smallest element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
